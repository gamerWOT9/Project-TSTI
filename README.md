## Project T1: Arduino-Powered Racing Competition 🏎️🔌

Welcome to Project T1, our end-of-year capstone project that brings the thrill of a race to life! 🏁💨

In this project, we pit two cars against each other: the daring "Blue" and the bold "Red". 🚗🚗

Using the power of an Arduino microcontroller and a variety of sensors, we track the number of laps and the total time taken by each car. 📏⏱️

The data collected is then sent to a Raspberry Pi, which processes it and stores the race results in a SQLite database. 💾📊

Finally, we display the race results on a Flask website for all to see! 🖥️🌐

## Project DRX: Second project but for bees 🌍🐝

Project DRX, an exciting addition, expands upon Project T1 by focusing on the display of data collected from sensors placed in a hive. 🐝📈

This project seamlessly feeds data into an SQLite database, which is then presented in both tabular and graphical formats for easy interpretation and analysis. 📊🎯

## Key Components 🛠️

- **Arduino Microcontroller**: The brains of our operation, tracking laps and time.
- **Sensors**: Accurately count laps and measure time.
- **Raspberry Pi**: The heart of our data processing and visualization system.
- **SQLite Database**: Stores race results efficiently.
- **Flask Web Application**: Brings the race results to life on the web.

## Getting Started 🚀

1. **Setup the Arduino and Sensors**: Configure your Arduino and connect the sensors.
2. **Raspberry Pi Setup**: Install the necessary software on your Raspberry Pi.
3. **Run the Arduino Program**: Deploy the program to start the race and collect data.
4. **Access the Flask Application**: View the race results in real-time on the Flask web application.
